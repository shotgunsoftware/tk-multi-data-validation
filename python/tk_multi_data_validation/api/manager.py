            a. If missing dependencies and `fetch_dependencies` not explicitly set to True then
               prompt user to fetch and resolve dependencies
            b. If `fetch_dependencies` is explicitly set to True or user answered YES to (a),
               then try to find any missing dependencies in the manager, and process them as
               done with the other rules

        3. Process the queue of rules (that have dependencies)
            a. If the rule's dependencies have been resolved or ignored - now resolve it and
               mark it as resolved
            b. If the rule's dependencies have not been resolved - add it back to the end of
               the queue

        The process_rule_callback is a function that is called for each rule that is
        processed. It must take a `ValidationRule` object as its first argument. For example,
        pass the `validate_rule` to process all rules and by validating each one.

        Time complexity (n = number of rules)

        1. O(n)
        2. O(n^2) - worst case

        NOTE: Time complexity is not the best with O(n^2) but is probably good enough since the list of
        validation rules is not expected to be so large. If the number of rules does grow to be a large
        list, then this fix operation may need to be optimized (e.g. build a dependency tree that defines
        the order of fixing the rules).
